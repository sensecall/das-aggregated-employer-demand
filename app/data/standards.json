Archaeological Specialists have specialised knowledge of one or more aspects of archaeological investigation and analysis. They are responsible for the processing, reporting and preparation for long-term deposition of archaeological data and materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with organisations of all sizes in the public, private and third sectors. Typically, they interact with colleagues, external stakeholders and members of the public. Archaeological Specialists work on site (outside, all weathers), in an office or in a laboratory, including operating technical equipment and carrying out physical tasks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for leading and undertaking Archaeological Research and Investigation, with a high level of responsibility for the delivery and quality of their own work and that of others. They are responsible for providing a specialist resource to colleagues. The size of the employer will impact the team the Archaeological Specialist is responsible for, or interacts with, but typically they will train and supervise less skilled personnel, and be responsible for the delivery of programmes and projects of all sizes and complexities, as well as communicating the results of the work internally and externally.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in health, education and social care. Arts Therapists work in a range of settings such as the NHS, local authorities, voluntary, or private sector, hospitals, clinics, education, shelters, hospices, or prisons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to use art, drama or music to carry out therapy interventions to improve a person’s mental, physical health and wellbeing. Arts Therapists are both artists in their chosen field and psychological therapists. They use art, drama or music as their primary mode of communication. Arts therapies can help to enhance general development, autonomy, social interaction and communication skills and can support both mental and physical rehabilitation. They may be used to address anxiety, confusion, pain, trauma and depression and to improve quality of life. Arts Therapists help the individual to experience themselves and others in different ways through the arts therapy intervention. This is particularly helpful when emotions are too confusing to express verbally, when verbal communication is difficult, or when words are not enough to relay feelings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide range of clients. Arts therapists may work across the full age range with clients who may have a wide range of difficulties, disabilities or diagnoses such as emotional, social, behavioural or mental health problems, learning or physical disabilities, injury, life-limiting conditions, neurological conditions or physical illnesses. Arts Therapy sessions may be delivered individually or in groups depending on the client’s needs. Arts therapists work closely with their team to provide and receive ongoing managerial, clinical and professional supervision and support. They also work with a range of wider stakeholders or organisations who may be involved in their client&#39;s care or support such as family, carers, education providers, health or social care services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for managing a caseload of clients with a wide variety of problems using client-centred approaches to assess a client’s needs. They devise support plans that takes into account the complex psychological, emotional, cognitive, physical, communicative and social needs of the client. They build rapport with clients and create a safe environment to help them to develop their self-awareness and self-confidence and to improve their functioning and promote mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a wide variety of organisations that oversee health and social care services such as Clinical Commissioning Groups, social services and community healthcare services. Continuing Healthcare services provide care for over 60,000 people over the age of 18 annually across England. It is estimated that 70% are in nursing homes, and 30% have care in their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to work as part of a Continuing Healthcare team which provide packages of on-going care that are arranged and funded solely by the NHS. The Associate Continuing Healthcare Practitioner plays a key role in the assessment of individual’s complex health and social care needs that have arisen as a result of disability, accident or illness, and the planning and commissioning of the services for these individuals. They also act as the first point of contact for individuals and their carers offering support, care and advice about the service and for young adults and their family who are transitioning from children’s continuing care into this adult continuing healthcare service. The Associate Continuing Healthcare Practitioner may be required to work shifts including evenings and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the individuals and their family, friends and carers, that have been referred into the continuing healthcare service, are being assessed or are receiving packages of care. They work with nurses, social workers, doctors and other health and social care colleagues involved in planning, reviewing and delivering services provided to the individual guiding them with expert knowledge of the specialist continuing healthcare regulations. They also regularly work with finance and procurement colleagues and the service providers to ensure contracts are being delivered as agreed. They may also have contact with legal and claims companies who are representing individuals who do not agree with the outcome of the assessment process. The Associate Continuing Healthcare Practitioner will need to have good communication skills to advocate for individuals and guide them through the emotionally stressful assessment process and any dispute process. They will also be required to have a detailed knowledge of the health and social care services available for these individuals who have complex and varying needs. The Associate Continuing Healthcare Practitioner will be primarily office-based but will also visit the individual in their home, and in health and social care settings.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for screening and assessing individuals for eligibility to continuing healthcare packages in line with the National Framework for Continuing Healthcare, related legislation and policy. To support this assessment work, they undertake analysis, interpretation and evaluation of evidence from multiple health and social care professionals caring for the individual. The Associate Continuing Healthcare Practitioner will also be responsible for managing a caseload of individuals who have been found eligible. This involves the planning and reviewing of the complex health and social care packages ensuring they continue to meet their needs. They will work autonomously, exercising judgement and work in partnership with other health and social care professionals to undertake non-routine assessments and reviews on individuals in line with the law.In most instances their work will be overseen by a registered health or social care professional such as a nurse, social worker or occupational therapist. The Associate Continuing Healthcare Practitioner will also have line management or supervisory responsibility for junior members of the team, acting as a role model, planning and managing their work.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the bicycle industry, which in the United Kingdom employs several thousand people. Bicycle mechanics may work in independent bicycle shops, hire centres, bicycle workshops and larger non-specialist retailers, as well as for sports clubs, race teams and bicycle-tour operators and other bicycle related organisations. Cycling is on the increase as a means of transport and as a leisure activity, with an increasing range of bicycles on offer – some with complex technology, making it an exciting and varied industry to work in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to build, repair and service all kinds of bicycles – for example road, mountain, hybrid, recumbent, disabled adapted, electric and other human powered road and off-road vehicles. As a definition, bicycles are human powered road vehicles with a varying number of wheels; this can include uni-cycles, tricycles, quadricycles and so on. Electric bicycles are electrically assisted or adapted bicycles as opposed to electric motorcycles. They work in bicycle shops, dedicated workshops, in the field for bicycle racing teams or independently as mobile mechanics and other areas where bicycles play a prominent part. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a bicycle is brought in for repair or service or when an ‘in-house’ bicycle needs to built, rebuilt or repaired, they run diagnostic tests to determine the cause of the problem, and then take the necessary steps to fix it. When parts aren’t available to hand, they will instigate the order for them to be obtained from a distributor or manufacturer. Sometimes bicycle repairs can be as simple as replacing cables or tyres, but sometimes they can require more complicated procedures like adjusting a frame or repairing brakes and gears. They may build bicycles or wheels from scratch. Whether a repair or build they need to complete safety checks. They may or may not interact with customers depending on the workplace, this may include talking to the customer to help identify the fault, providing estimates – recommending when it is economically viable to repair and/or the handover of the built/repaired bicycle with an explanation of the work completed. They will need to complete documentation, for example relating to the work completed or warranty claims. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other bicycle mechanics (depending on size of operation) and suppliers; interacting with customers/clients is usually part of the role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for responsible for completing work under the supervision of a senior mechanic or other management structure depending on the organisation. The work can be physically demanding and involves using various tools and chemicals, like cleaning products and greasing agents. Working in a manner that ensures the health and safety of self and others is essential.&lt;/p&gt;"

Transitions could include from learning to work, returning to the labour market, returning to learning, sector/organisation/management change, redundancy and pre-retirement choices. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for helping individuals assess their own strengths, values, beliefs, and situation and connect them meaningfully to the labour market and the education system.

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;The clock maker is found in the Heritage and museum, manufacturing, retail and repair, public and Industrial sectors. A clock maker is someone who is able to use their skill and labour to service, repair and manufacture components for a range of clocks as well as being able to manufacture a complete clock. The work is skilled and precise in nature and requires the use of hand and machine tools as well as an understanding of horological theory and history. As most of the work undertaken by clock makers is the repair and restoration of clock mechanisms, it is important that a good understanding of the topics below is grasped.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A clock maker should be able to manufacture or specify for manufacture all the components within a clock.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A clock maker may find themselves working in a small team for another clock maker, or as part of a jewellery business. Individuals could eventually, with further training, go on to become self-employed, servicing clocks for others and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work an employee would interact with members of the public, other clock makers who are manufacturing specified components, suppliers, managers/employer, and other team members when working in a manufacturing or retail environment. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for basic maintenance of tools and understanding of the appropriate level of Health and Safety legislation. The employee would expected to be able to service and recognise faults within standard striking platform and pendulum clocks with minimal supervision, however for more complex work they may seek further guidance. It is expected that the employee will have an awareness of restoration, conservation practices and ethical practice.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h5&gt;&#160;&lt;/h5&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;The Counter Fraud Investigator (CFI) operates within the law enforcement sector and would typically be employed by HMRC, DEFRA, Department of Health, Insolvency Service, DWP, SFO and Local Government. The CFI acts autonomously leading small non-complex criminal investigations and a range of civil investigations. They can also act as case officer within a large investigation team, as required, carrying out parts of a more complex investigation as directed by the Lead Investigator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broadly, it is the CFI&#39;s responsibility to proactively investigate allegations of fraud and make effective, autonomous operational decisions from referral to conclusion to drive their investigations. Conclusion could mean support of a successful prosecution, levy of penalty (or equivalent) or no further action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CFI fully understands the range of interventions available to them when investigating fraud in relation to assigned matters, policies and legislation, then decides on the most appropriate method to proceed. To do this the CFI uses knowledge of civil procedures such as applications to tribunal, giving evidence at tribunal and Judicial Review, knowledge of associated civil penalties and other enforcement measures such as insolvency action. The CFI understands when it is more appropriate to conduct or switch to a criminal investigation how to do this and how to work safely within the Criminal Justice System. The CFI has knowledge and understanding of PACE, RIPA, CPIA, HRA, PoCA and/or other legislation to apply for Warrants and Orders. The CFI interacts with Lawyers, Judges, Magistrates, other professionals and other law enforcement partners, to achieve these and other work objectives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CFI plans and conducts different types of evidence gathering activity and takes/maintains notes appropriate to that activity. This involves interaction with members of the public from all backgrounds and conducting tasks such as a formal meeting with a company director or professional advisor, interview under caution, taking third party witness statements, making evidential notes of searches and observations during surveillance. The CFI operates for extended periods in any type of environment from an office or court room to a building site or multi occupancy residence, depending on the direction their enquiries lead them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evidence gathering situations include searches of premises, review of business accounts and their constituent parts and other professional documents. The CFI understands and is able to search digital databases and other online platforms. They recognise Legally Privileged Material and other protected information as described in law and treat it appropriately. They quickly identify evidence in fast paced sometimes confrontational situations amongst what will mainly be irrelevant material. They understand the different types of surveillance available, when it is necessary and proportionate to use surveillance and the duty of care to the citizen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CFI role may involve confrontational situations, including arrest, and the CFI properly risk assesses any activity undertaken by creating plans to mitigate or reduce the identified risks where possible. They write professional briefings to ensure that all colleagues engaged in any planned investigation activity are aware of their roles and responsibilities and the risks identified. They take on a leadership role in the work they are conducting and are accountable for their actions and decisions, able to explain these to senior leaders, prosecutors and officers of the court as a witness.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in all healthcare settings including, primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare, independent and private healthcare sectors.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide excellent patient care by obtaining images of a high diagnostic quality using a range of high cost and complex imaging equipment. This will include imaging using x-rays and cross-sectional imaging methods (Computed Tomography or CT), fluoroscopy and Interventional Radiology and will be able to assist in other imaging modalities such as Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Breast Imaging and Nuclear Medicine. Diagnostic Radiographers work with a broad range of patients, e.g. patients who may have mental and/or physical disabilities or be distressed, children and the terminally ill. They work independently to assess, authorise, obtain consent and undertake individual examination requests for radiography procedures. They will critique images and determine appropriate actions. The work is physically and mentally demanding and involves direct patient contact, which can be of a personal nature.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with patients, their carers, members of the public and other healthcare staff e.g. porters, nurses, other allied health professionals, doctors, external contractors, engineers and medical physicists etc. They will primarily work in diagnostic imaging departments in hospitals (inpatients and outpatients), but also provide mobile imaging on Wards, including the Intensive Care Unit, Neonatal Unit, Emergency Department and Operating Theatres. Diagnostic Radiographers may also provide imaging in stand- alone satellite units.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the safe use of imaging equipment and the safe conduct of examinations, including the radiation protection of patients, themselves, staff and visitors. As registered autonomous practitioners they are accountable both professionally and legally for their own actions and for those operating under their supervision as they deliver safe and compassionate care. Work may be undertaken independently or as part of a team. They may refer to another healthcare professional for advice; however, this may not always be available at night in smaller organisations or in satellite departments. They are expected to contribute to a 24-hour, 7-day week imaging service with varying shift patterns and on call service and, on occasion, may be the sole provider of imaging services for the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;"

Some dietitians will be freelance and self-employed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to use advanced communication and behaviour-change skills to enable people to make lifestyle and food choices to improve their health. Dietitians work in partnership with individual to assess, diagnose and monitor the impact of jointly agreed treatment plans.

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in industries and organisations that interact and communicate with their customers and end user online, for example the videogame industry and software providers. It is a key role for such employers, from small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to large organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to facilitate and instigate direct communication online between the end user or customer and the organisation. The customers who are communicating with the organisation are referred to as ‘the community&#39;. Digital Community Managers are the ‘public face’ online for an organisation, implementing their communication strategy to support its business objectives. This is achieved through the management of online media channels and delivering activities such as release information, updates and responding to questions from the community. Digital Community Managers deliver information and useful ideas from the community to their organisation and are the ‘eyes and ears’ of the organisation within the player community. Conversely, they provide information from their organisation back to the community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work an employee in this occupation routinely works with multiple communities on-line. Information has to be delivered in the unique tone and voice of each community. The community can run from hundreds to many thousands of customers dependent on the size of the product or game. As they talk to a considerable number of customers with each interaction they have a huge responsibility to accurately and appropriately represent the organisation, a mis-step or badly handled communication can have a detrimental impact on an organisations reputation or revenue. Digital Community Managers work within an office environment and are part of a team developing and implementing an overall communication strategy. They work autonomously but will interact with other departments in an organisation including public relations (pr),marketing, production and communication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for analysing and interpreting data from the community. Their evaluation of customers&#39; behaviour and data is reported upwards in the organisation, feeding into future communication strategies and product direction. Digital Community Managers are responsible for reviewing their own work and understanding the impact of their communication in order to better inform future interactions. The nature of the work is autonomous as online communication is fast moving and often needs to be timely without requiring supervision. Therefore they have a high degree of responsibility and need to exercise good judgement for their own work within the parameters defined by their organisation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digital Community Managers report to Senior Digital Community Managers, Communications Managers and Communication Directors.&lt;/p&gt;"

They work across numerous different organisations and settings for example; primary care, social care, third sector organisations, hospitals including mental health, hospices, prisons and other community services to ensure that patients get the right care, at the right time, every time.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is work with individuals and populations. This can mean working with people in their own home (which could be an individual’s house, a care home, a hostel, a prison, hotels etc.), a healthcare setting e.g. GP practice, hospital, hospice etc. or even the streets in the case of the homeless population. District Nurses assess and care for patients with a wide range of health conditions and are accountable for a large varied complex caseload where they prioritise care, assess risk, prescribe medication, dressings and appliances in accordance with legislation, manage changing local demands which require very careful oversight and case management. They plan, provide and monitor complex community nursing care and services. They manage a caseload of complex patients and families/carers, either with long-term conditions over a protracted period or those with acute short episodes of care, by leading a clinical team who often work in isolation without immediate and direct access to medical advice. They influence and lead change management initiatives within the service, for example, new ways of working, new models of care. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are responsible for delivery of care across a 24 hour period 365 days a year anticipating problems and crises and proactively planning to prevent unnecessary hospital admission and facilitating timely discharge across a range of patient pathways e.g. end of life care, tissue viability etc.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with patients, their carer’s and relatives and a wide variety of health and social care professionals including GP’s, social workers and hospital staff. District Nurses work with adults of all ages and communities. They work across numerous different organisations and settings for example; primary care, social care, third sector organisations, hospitals including mental health, hospices, prisons and other community services to ensure that patients get the right care, at the right time, every time. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for their own work as an autonomous, independent practitioner, whilst contributing and leading collaborative work with other health and care professionals. In addition the occupation will be responsible for a caseload of patients and the team responsible for delivering care to that caseload.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the engineering sector working in the hospitality, retail, leisure and catering industries, in a variety of venues that serve soft-drinks and/or alcoholic beverages to the public on a daily basis, including public houses, bars, clubs, retail outlets, leisure centres, hotels, festivals/events, clubs, schools, cinemas, theatres, stadiums and many more. Drinks dispense technicians may work directly for a brand owner or brewery, or contractors that provide engineering services work on their behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is responsibility for the installation and maintenance of drinks dispense systems. The aim is to build, install, maintain and repair complex drinks dispensing equipment to ensure that their customer can, in turn, deliver drinks of the right specification and quality to their customers. Some drinks dispense technicians will specialise in certain types of drinks and/or brands, whilst others will work across a wide spectrum, for example beer, wine, cider, nitrogenated coffee and soft-drinks. The role involves the application of a broad range of knowledge and skills; including fault-finding, plumbing, electrical, refrigeration, gas pressure systems and pipework. Tasks are often complex and non-routine requiring the technician to identify and initiate the appropriate solution; problem solving, use of diagnostic skills and own initiative will be needed to address out of specification issues that may be encountered. An essential part of the role is informing, educating and providing guidance to the customer in equipment use, beverage quality and delivery of the perfect pour. Product sampling may be required. Depending on the work required, they may spend the day at one venue or working across a number of outlets, working to deadlines. It will often involve working in confined spaces, such as a cellar. They may be working on the dispense system as a whole, or on certain parts, such as the python (pipework composite encompassing capacity for multiple product lines and temperature control), coolers or dispense fonts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with venue staff for example managers, service staff and site security; other drinks dispense Technicians; colleagues, for example operations managers, call centre staff, quality managers and logistics managers; and members of the public. Technicians will self-manage work load and flow and will typically report to a Technical Manager. Depending on the size of the project Technicians may have responsibility for leading and supervising a team of Technicians. When working on new builds/renovations, they may interact with site supervisors and other trades for example plumbers and electricians. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for planning tasks and the resources required in response to schedules, ensuring the quality and accuracy of work carried out. They have the authority to determine the action required in relation to the drinks dispense system in a venue; including shut down. They will need to make informed judgements and decisions, taking account of the situation. They work autonomously, responsible for adhering to health &amp;amp; safety, current legislation, asbestos guidelines, working at height regulations and British Beer and Pub Association and British Soft Drinks Association Codes of Practice. They are responsible for asset management, including vehicle, tools, specialist equipment and devices. Typically, a driving licence will be required as they may be expected to drive to their place of work, using a company vehicle, and coordinate logistics for other technicians.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the public sector, typically in local authorities, but also in third-party and private businesses. The majority will be employed in local government and in private industry although they may also carry out their duties in a wider range of settings including: central government, consultancies, the NHS, armed services, public health protection, not for profit businesses and charities. They will work in a range of departments in which they will apply their professional knowledge and skills on a range of areas, such as environmental protection, food safety, health and safety at work, housing standards and public health. This occupation could be based locally, regionally, nationally or internationally.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to act as advisers, educators, consultants and enforcement officers, enabling people to live and work in safe, healthy environments. By undertaking a risk-based approach, Environmental Health Practitioners (EHPs) will promote a safe and healthy environment for the public and businesses, through education and enforcement. For example, inspecting food premises and workplaces for food safety and health and safety compliance, monitoring air quality, undertaking emergency interventions, investigating food fraud, safety and noise control at large events, dealing with rogue landlords, investigating food poisoning outbreaks, licensing tattoo parlours and investigating accidents at work. They work in a range of environments and will spend much of their time out in the community with businesses and the public. They may have to work evenings and weekends to meet the job needs. EHPs may specialise in one of the following areas, or deal with them all:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Environmental protection including noise, nuisance, air, water and land pollution&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Food safety: auditing, inspection and education&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Health and safety at work: auditing, inspection and education&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Private sector housing including standards: houses in multiple occupation (HMOs), licensing, inspecting&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Public health including infectious disease control, smoke free legislation&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Port health: sampling, inspecting and controlling imported foods&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Training eg. delivering food safety/health and safety courses/mentoring&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a variety of stakeholders including:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the public&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;clients&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;local and/or national businesses&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;elected members&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;property owners&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;local and national government agencies and departments&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;partners, such as the police and fire service.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Typically working remotely or from an office base, EHPs will spend much of their time out in the community with businesses and the public. They work in a range of settings from residential situations to highly dangerous conditions, mainly in commercial and industrial settings. EHPs will work in situations where there is potential for conflict. They will provide expert, professional and technical advice to other council departments, external organisations, members of the public and businesses. They will attend council committees, courts of law, tribunals, public meetings etc. related to the prime objectives of the role.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working independently with a high level of autonomy and as part of a wider team. EHPs will plan, organise and prioritise their own case load, typically reporting to a line manager. They will work largely unsupervised and will be expected to exercise initiative and professional judgement, often being required to make quick decisions. They will work to ensure that outcomes and objectives are achieved within desired timescales. They may be responsible for the following resources: safety equipment, sampling equipment, measuring equipment, photographic and video equipment and electronic equipment. This includes the management of any chains of evidence collected. They will also be responsible for sensitive and personal information. EHPs may be expected to supervise technical staff and students. EHPs should demonstrate a commitment to their own continuing professional development.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a broad and growing employment sector, with organisations of all types seeking to promote sustainable growth in a manner that is practical whilst responsible, using fewer natural resources, producing less waste, and without compromising the quality of the built and natural environment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once confined to conservation, waste management or pollution prevention, the occupation has become more mainstream, infiltrating into many areas of the business world. &lt;br /&gt;Environmental Practitioners are employed in a wide variety of job roles across many sectors including:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the voluntary and charity sectors;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;public sector including regulatory bodies, local and national authorities;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;educational institutions and research agencies; and&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Private sector companies; ranging from multinational companies to smaller business requiring environmental practitioners&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide employers with a high level of professional environmental expertise, whilst providing a robust overview of key issues and the relevant policies, regulations and legislation an organisation must consider when delivering a specific project or programme. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Environmental Practitioners will combine a high level of knowledge and understanding of environmental principles and techniques to complex environmental systems, with their expertise being developed, adaptable or transferable to a range of environmental specialisms, for example, environmental policy and legislation, air quality, climate change, energy, water resources, waste management, ecology, acoustics, land contamination, sustainability, landscape or heritage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Environmental Practitioners have the capability to manage, at an operational level, the provision of innovative solutions that maintain, enhance and minimise environmental impacts, for example, when designing, developing, refurbishing or monitoring drainage, utilities, renewable or emerging technologies, coastal or flood defences, transport systems, or major development programmes across the urban, rural and natural environments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often, Environmental Practitioners are the first point of contact for the initiation, management and analysis of specialist environmental tests and activities, research and field inspections, through to the provision of appropriate policy, regulatory and legislative guidance, all of which support the successful management and protection of the natural, built and human environments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with junior and senior members of their own project team, typically in an office-based environment; They will work with technical specialists both within and beyond their profession, for example, environmental managers and consultants, environmental impact assessors, design and commissioning engineers and architects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Environmental Practitioners will also be exposed to site/field-based activities, where they will safely carry out the collection and monitoring of data using a range of techniques, and will typically engage with surveyors, construction site personnel, environmental protection officers and regulators. &lt;br /&gt;Practitioners will build relationships within and external to their organisation, provide guidance and present work internally and externally to clients and other stakeholders, utilising their excellent written, oral and interpersonal communication skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for leading projects and/or playing a key role in a larger programme and must manage their own work with a high level of autonomy, have the capability to respond positively to complex and unpredictable situations, and be able to influence and make decisions that support others across and external to the organisation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practitioners will also be aware and responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;initiation, coordination, and management of technical input from a wide range of specialists,&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;ensuring projects and programmes are planned and delivered effectively and in a timely manner&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the compliance and review of these projects with relevant regulatory requirements&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;line management or development responsibilities for other team members, such as Environmental Technicians&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;their own capability and capacity and seek help from others such as specialist technical experts to support them in their role&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;operating effectively within their organisational, financial, and resource constraints and policies, and being compliant with statutory safety and employment regulations&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;maintaining high levels of professional conduct, ethical behaviour and integrity at all times&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Environmental Practitioners can also be involved in a range of more specialist fields covering air quality, acoustics, ecology, landscape, heritage and water resources, and as such this can be reflected in job titles such as Air Quality Engineer, Acoustics Engineer, Energy Engineer, Energy and Renewables Engineer, Waste Planner, Water Environmental Consultant, Water and Flood Risk Consultant, Flood Risk Advisor, Cities Engineer, Energy Manager, Sustainability Architect, or Environmental Regulatory Consultant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

Depending on the product they may add glass units, ancillary items for example, fixings and fastening, handles, hinges, locks and louvers, along with weatherproofing for example, gaskets, seals, membranes and sealants. Regardless of the product or material, it involves working to a specification, in line with quality standards, health and safety and environmental considerations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the production/general manager whom they report to and depending on the size of the organisation customers (internal/external), other fabricators, delivery personnel, design office, internal stores and suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for completing their own work, with minimal supervision, ensuring they meet set deadlines. They may work as part of a team, with responsibility for a specific aspect of the fabricator process, contributing to the production of the overall product.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the manufacturing, creative and design sectors across the apparel (clothing) industry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UK apparel industry consists of mainly micro, small and medium enterprises, producing premium garments for various markets, including womenswear, menswear and childrenswear, for example from bespoke tailored suits, creative designer womenswear, and costumes for opera and theatre, to luxury fashion and couture pieces as seen on catwalks in major capitals across the world.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to construct garments - bringing the design to life, following specifications and quality standards. They may work on one-off products for specific customers or garment samples to be replicated. They help determine the best production method for each design, review fit, deal with manufacturing issues and monitor resources. Garment makers know and understand the end-to-end garment making process. They are extremely proficient sewers, operating sewing machines effectively and applying stitching techniques by hand. They work with different materials and trimmings, appropriate to the design. They work to a high level of accuracy; with close attention to detail, they apply efficient time management skills and may need to work under pressure to meet customer or season deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with personnel involved in garment design, development and production. It will vary depending on the business size, structure and working environment. Typically, in a small production unit, they would interact with the designer and pattern cutter. In a workshop producing couture or bespoke garments, they may interact with a tailor, cutter or the designer. In a wider factory setting, they may work as part of a larger team, this could mean working in a sample room or on the factory floor, interacting with production tailors, designers, product technologists, pattern cutters, fabric cutters, quality controllers and sewing machinists.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the pursuit of excellence in relation to the assembly, finish and look of the end product. Throughout the construction of the garment, they need to meet the design brief, which includes specifications and quality standards. They must work effectively on their own or as part of a wider team and must comply with health and safety requirements..&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;The Apprentice will be employed in zoos, wildlife parks, aquariums, private animal collections, animal reserves, and farms with a zoo licence. The role of a Zoo Keeper or Aquarist will include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Interpreting diet Sheets, preparing and delivering Animal feeds&lt;br /&gt;• Servicing, cleaning and managing Animal environments&lt;br /&gt;• Providing Species specific habitats and routines for animals in line with their natural history&lt;br /&gt;• Observing and understanding Animal behaviour, Animal Health and Welfare, recording and reporting findings&lt;br /&gt;• Checking enclosure and other work areas for potential or existing hazards&lt;br /&gt;• Engaging with visitors and stakeholders, tailoring information to the audience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keepers and aquarists assist and adhere to the zoological collections and industry best practice, law, protocols and procedures in relation to animal husbandry, welfare, transportation and work health and safety. They will learn about and understand the role of key stakeholders in their area of work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the everyday care and husbandry of the animals within the collection. They will understand species specific behaviour and needs and the basics of animal training. They will record and report any observed changes and concerns to senior animal keeping staff/management and learn the use of up to date recording systems like ZIMS. The Apprentice will use tools on the job which are needed for cleaning enclosures, enclosure maintenance and design and food preparation. They will be expected to complete day to day tasks using their initiative, within a specific time period. This will vary with the size of collection, in smaller organisations they will have complete autonomy on a day-to-day basis and in larger organisations they may work within a team. It is likely it may involve unsociable hours and working outside in all weather conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with volunteers, animal keepers who are less experienced and more experienced, management, veterinary staff, staff from other departments, colleagues from other zoological collections and members of the public. They will report concerns to senior animal keeping staff/management and will use tools on the job which are needed for cleaning enclosures, enclosure maintenance and design and food preparation. They will do this in a confident and polite manner. They will be expected to complete day to day tasks using their own initiative. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keepers and aquarists will also be required to encourage public engagement with wildlife, conservation breeding and conservation education. They will be required to research, gather and present information for educational presentations relating to the species in their area and to promote understanding with different audiences such as visitors and other internal stakeholders. This may be done through presentations and demonstrations with the animals, explaining different characteristics of the animals to visitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Animal Keeper or Aquarist will have a strong work ethic and show respect and empathy for both people and animals.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Set within an industry steeped in tradition, the leather trade supports the pursuit of excellence in its traditional craft skills whilst also embracing innovation and technology. The leather craftsperson is a fundamental occupational role in the leather trade and in a sector that contributes in excess of &#163;700 million to the British economy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;British leather and leather products have an international and iconic reputation and the continued success of the sector will depend on maintaining a skilled, well-trained workforce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Leather craftsperson’ is a broad description of someone who either produces the leather or manufactures leather goods for a number of markets from sporting pursuits, such as equestrian, golf and cricket applications, to high-end retail luxury goods, such as handbags luggage and lifestyle accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation may work in a small enterprise producing or manufacturing specialist leather/leathergoods or in a wider factory setting as part of a production or manufacturing team producing to larger orders. They will be able to work just as effectively on their own or as part of a wider team. In both instances they will understand the impact of their role on those working around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Standard is designed to give an overarching range of skills, knowledge and behaviours appropriate to both the production of leather and the manufacture of leather goods. The former involving taking raw skin and hides and converting them through chemical and mechanical processing, to produce leather ready for a variety of applications. The latter involving taking leather and forming a finished product from it, often involving processes such as stitching and cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of which methods the employers’ use, leather craftspeople will know and understand the end-to-end process of how leather is produced and the manufacturing processes required to produce a final leathergoods product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working efficiently and accurately to agreed product specifications and customer requirements, using both hand and machine skills, within agreed production deadlines and to the required quality standard. In their daily work they will report to line managers and supervisors and often will interact with production colleagues. Typical working pattern is Monday to Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Typical day-to-day duties may include:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The production of leather (processing and finishing);&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Quality check materials and components for faults;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Leather cutting operations;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Skive materials (shaving/reducing weight) ready for next stage of production;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Prepare materials ready for next stage of production;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Ink / paint raw / cut leathers edge;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Hand / Machine sew leather components and where applicable assembles the components to produce the finished product;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Examine finished leather / leather product for quality;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Repair and/or rework leather/leather goods;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Package product and label for onward journey.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Occupational brief: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Trailblazer Group have prepared a recommended&#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ukft.org/skills-and-training/apprenticeships/what-is-available/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;occupational brief&lt;/a&gt;&#160;for this apprenticeship standard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

User needs vary across sectors and could include finding textbooks to support their learning; legal materials to support law activities; images to create a design; trademark information to create a new product; health information to diagnose a patient etc. Digital services, digital literacy, information literacy, general literacy, customer service, problem solving, organisation of resources and systems underpin and characterise the work in this profession. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work with people from all parts of society and the workforce, providing essential digital and analogue information services – issuing and returning materials, organizing collections, answering research and information queries, improving customers’ literacy skills, – quite often at the forefront of innovation.

The purpose of the marine survey is to establish the condition of the subject ship or vessel (or parts, machinery, equipment or systems) and any potential or actual damage or repairs required thereto, and verify the subject ship&#39;s or other vessel&#39;s suitability and fitness to operate, including appropriate certification for same. The value of a subject ship or other vessel (or its constituent parts, machinery, equipment or systems) is also established through marine survey commissioned for such purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide range of marine professionals, including: the Master (Captain), Chief Engineer and crews of ships or other vessels; client or subject company representatives (such as Marine Superintendents, Brokers, Administrators and Managers); maritime regulators (such as Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) officials, Classification Society staff, naval architects and marine engineers and Certifying Authority specialists); insurance loss adjusters; and commercial or private clients and their representatives, including legal professionals. While much of the planning for a survey is undertaken in an office environment, the surveys themselves are undertaken onboard the subject ship or other vessel, either in port (alongside a quayside or in a dry dock) or, from time-to-time, during operations. A Marine Surveyor is expected to maintain a level of personal drive and fitness to work outside in all weathers, and to inspect all parts of a ship or small vessel, including safe working at heights and in confined spaces.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for providing professional services of expert survey (including close examination and inspection for verification of standards, regulations and rules) of ships or other vessels, constituent parts, machinery, equipment and systems, including planning for and safe conduct of the survey itself, and production and presentation of written and oral reports of the survey&#39;s results and outcomes. Such reports and presentations will require production of high-quality documents that will provide evidence, imagery, conclusions, recommendations and, where required by the purpose, relevant valuations. Marine Surveyors may work alone, jointly with equivalent Surveyors from other interested parties, or in company with other surveyors for whom they could be responsible. Working to the instructions provided and from their own professional knowledge, the Marine Surveyor will have significant autonomy for the planning, completeness and safe conduct of, and reporting of the survey. In conduct of a survey, Marine Surveyor may have to manage their own work with due consideration of the environment and of other persons, including ship&#39;s staff or technical contractors.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a wide variety of Thermal Process related fields including Casting, Forging, Machining, Coating, Heat treatment and Surface Finishing processes. These specialist areas are also found in a wide range of industries where materials and their processes are fundamental to the technology . Industries as diverse as Medical, Defence, Energy, Oil and Gas, Aerospace and Nuclear all incorporate the skills of Materials Process Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to perform a role which is unique to the materials/manufacturing community, controlling and managing the complex manufacturing processes and support services that are applied to products for the automotive, aerospace, medical, energy and construction sectors. They do this by collecting and organising all the information needed to understand the whole problem, exploring it from all angles, and then finding the most appropriate solution for integration into a sustainable product life cycle. A Materials Process Engineer might typically work in either the problem definition or solution provider environments, making critical decisions in the process and utilities to produce high-quality, cost-effective parts and systems, then testing and accepting the designed solutions. They provide essential support to their associated businesses providing guidance and leadership in improving company metrics of quality, delivery, new product introduction and support key financial and business decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with all departments within the companies they work for and at a range of levels within the departments depending on the project in which they are engaged. Their main focus will be with the Engineering team and they will also have strong links in support of the Operations team. However to fulfil many of the projects, links to finance, supply chain and customer support will be a day to day occurrence and as the activities broaden there will be strong communication to the wider external customer base both in a sales support activity and during technical project discussions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for implementing new products and processes and for many cost reduction and process improvement initiatives. They have direct responsibility for defining the methods of manufacture of complex engineering systems and the asset base and services which are used to produce high value manufactured products. In many cases weekly and monthly reports will be required at both team level and to senior members of the company.&lt;/p&gt;"

Fabricators can work alone or in teams, in factories or on operational sites.Fabricators use a large range of metals including steel, aluminium and titanium at a range of thicknesses from 0.5mm up to over 20mm. The size and weight of the fabrications can range from components that can easily be picked up by hand, to massive structures that require several cranes to manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with planners, supervisors, inspectors, designers, welders, pipefitters, fitters, machinists, riggers, steel erectors, stores personnel, painters and many others involved in manufacturing, production, maintenance and repair.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the quality and accuracy of their own work whilst ensuring it conforms to a relevant specification such as an engineering drawing or an international standard. Fabricators are also responsible for the health, safety and environmental (HS&amp;amp;E) protection of themselves and others around them.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This is a new occupation introduced into the health and care workforce to bridge the gap between health and care assistants and registered nurses. Nursing associate is a stand-alone role that will also provide a progression route into graduate level nursing. It’s intended that the role will enable registered nurses to focus on more complex clinical duties. Nursing associates work in the public, independent and voluntary sectors and it is a statutorily regulated profession. The standards for proficiency are set by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). Successful completion of this apprenticeship will meet the education requirements for registration with the NMC. This standard covers the NMC Standards for Proficiency and Annexes A &amp;amp; B for nursing associates (October 2018).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide care for people of all ages and from different backgrounds, cultures and beliefs. Nursing associates may provide care for people who have mental, physical, cognitive and behavioural care needs. They may provide care for people in their own home, in the community or hospital or in any health care settings where their needs are supported and managed. Nursing associates work in the context of continual change, challenging environments, different models of care delivery, shifting demographics, innovation and rapidly evolving technologies. Increasing integration of health and social care services will require nursing associates to play an active role in multidisciplinary teams.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nursing associates contribute to the promotion of health, health protection and the prevention of ill health. They do this by empowering people and communities to exercise choice, take control of their own health decisions and behaviours and by supporting people to manage their own care where possible. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a variety of service users, families and carers, and with an extensive range of health and care professionals and other agencies including social services, police, probation, prisons, housing, education, language interpreters and third sector agencies. They might be working in a health, social care or public health provider and may work various shift patterns which enable care to be provided 24 hours per day, seven days per week, 365 days of the year. This is a new role and it is expected that nursing associates will become a key part of the team to meet the integrated health and care needs of patients and service users.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for providing care for people of all ages and from different backgrounds, cultures and beliefs. They must be able to care for people in their own home, in the community or hospital or in any care settings where their needs are supported and managed. All nursing associates will work as part of a team but on a day to day basis they may be working alone when seeing people in their own homes or in the community. They work in the context of continual change, challenging environments, different models of care delivery, an older and more diverse population, innovation and rapidly evolving technologies. Increasing integration of health and social care services will require nursing associates to negotiate boundaries and play an important role in multidisciplinary teams. The confidence to apply knowledge and skills and provide evidence based, direct nursing care therefore lies at the centre of all nursing associate practice.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nursing associates must be emotionally intelligent and resilient individuals, able to manage their own personal health and well-being, recognise boundaries of their practice and know when and how to access support.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a wide range of sectors where piping systems are used for fluid transport and pressure containment. This will include Engineering Construction, Maintenance and Project upgrades, Oil &amp;amp; Gas (upstream extraction, bulk fluid transport &amp;amp; distribution, downstream processing), Chemicals &amp;amp; Pharmaceuticals (manufacturing and process plant); Power Generation (Thermal, Biomass &amp;amp; Nuclear); Food, Dairy &amp;amp; Brewery Process plant and equipment; Water and Water treatment (processing, bulk transport &amp;amp; distribution and remediation); and Fuel &amp;amp; Coolant systems for Transport Vehicles (Aerospace, Marine, Road &amp;amp; Rail systems). Employers range in size from small businesses to multi-national organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to manually weld tubes and pipes to high standards of quality and integrity using a minimum of two manual arc welding processes from Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG), Plasma Arc Welding (PAW), Manual Metal Arc (MMA), Metal Inert Gas (MIG)/Metal Active Gas (MAG) and Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW). The occupation requires the pipe welding of a minimum of four material groups from Carbon Steel, Low Alloy Steel, High Alloy Ferritic/Martensitic Steel, Austenitic Stainless Steel, Nickel &amp;amp; Nickel Alloys, Aluminium &amp;amp; Aluminium alloys, Titanium &amp;amp; Titanium Alloys, Copper &amp;amp; Copper Alloys. Pipe welders must use all welding positions and 3 main joint configurations from Single Sided Butt, Socket, Flange and Set-on Branch welds. For example, a pipe welder might use Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) and Manual Metal Arc (MMA) to join Carbon Steel, Low Alloy Steel, Austenitic Stainless Steel and Nickel Alloy materials. Each welding process requiring significantly different welding equipment, assemblies, controls, skills and techniques, and represents an individual production process. Each material type requires specific controls and techniques to achieve a satisfactory weld. The final components being welded are often used in highly safety critical applications for the movement and control of high temperature fluids, cryogenic fluids, highly corrosive or flammable media, and are regulated by the Pressure Equipment Directive. Some piping systems are used in the processing of pharmaceuticals, food and drink, where welding and fabrication control of pipe bore cleanliness is vital to the hygiene and integrity of the installation and quality of goods manufactured. Pipe Welders are required to continually monitor and adapt their orientation to achieve the quality of work demanded by high integrity piping systems, necessitating significant manual dexterity, and coordination. This is essential to the UK economy as Pipe Welders are key to the successful fabrication, construction and repair &amp;amp; maintenance of major infrastructure projects. Pipe welders are required to work to detailed engineering specifications necessary to ensure safe &amp;amp; reliable operation of the finished pipe work system. Pipe welders support many employers in the construction, engineering and manufacturing sectors. They can be employed by the supply chain organisations or the direct owner/operator.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide range of people and organisations including Supervisors, Engineers, Pipe Fitters, Riggers, Stores Operatives, Welding Inspectors, Non-Destructive Technicians, Quality personnel, Insurance Inspectors and associated Technicians (e.g. Thermal Treatment, Non-Destructive Testing). Pipe welders’ work is regularly assessed to ensure continued quality of welding though visual inspection, non-destructive testing and pre-commissioning pressure testing (hydraulic or pneumatic testing).They can work anywhere in the world and provide services in a range of demanding environments, including working at height, confined spaces, on live plant and equipment. This could include fabrication workshops, oil rigs, power stations, process plant facilities, on-board marine vessels. Pipe welders may need to work shifts and flexible work patterns. They can work in organisations ranging from multi-national organisations to very small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the safety, quality, productivity and accuracy of their own work whilst ensuring it conforms to a relevant pipe welding specification. Ensuring the bore cleanliness is maintained to the requirements of the piping system to assure the integrity of the system, components and product that will flow within the completed pipe system. Pipe Welders can hold a range of responsibilities ranging from working autonomously during their planning and production activities to being an integrated part of a wider team working on the overall pipework system, reporting to a workplace supervisor. This can vary based on the size of organisation and sector in which they work.&lt;/p&gt;"

This will include Structural Steel fabrication and construction (e.g. Buildings, Stadia, Bridges, Piers, Jetties etc.), Marine fabrication, construction and upgrade (Ships, Submarines, Wind Turbine Towers), Defence fabrication (armoured vehicles), Process Plant (structures and storage tanks), Engineering Construction (Lifting Beams, Cranes, Construction Vehicles etc.), Mining &amp;amp; Mineral Processing (Shuttering, Structural Supports, Wear Plates, Chutes, Mills, Pulverisers), Transport (Aerospace, Rail and Automotive), and Manufacturing of machinery &amp;amp; equipment. Plate Welders may be employed in any size of organisation from small companies to large multi-national organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to manually weld plate and structural components to high standards of quality. This will involve fabrication, construction or repair of fabricated plate assemblies, extrusions and structural components (e.g. Channel, H-Beams, I-Beams etc.) used often used to fabricate larger components and assemblies. Plate welders will weld to internationally recognised quality standards using more than one manual arc welding process from Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG), Plasma Arc Welding (PAW), Manual Metal Arc (MMA), Metal Inert Gas (MIG)/Metal Active Gas (MAG) and Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW) on more than one material group from Carbon Steel, Low Alloy Steel, High Alloy Ferritic/Martensitic Steel, Austenitic Stainless Steel, Nickel &amp;amp; Nickel Alloys, Aluminium &amp;amp; Aluminium alloys, Titanium &amp;amp; Titanium Alloys, Copper &amp;amp; Copper Alloys. For example, a Plate Welder might use Manual Metal Arc (MMA) and Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW) to join both Carbon Steel and Low Alloy Steel materials. The occupation requires production of welds in plate and structural components covering three plate welding positions which must include Vertical (either upward or downward progression) and Overhead, and the three main joint configurations (Single or Double Sided Butt, Single or Double Sided T-Butt &amp;amp; Fillet). Each welding process requiring significantly different welding equipment, assemblies, controls, skills and techniques, and represents an individual production process. Each material type requires specific controls and techniques to achieve a satisfactory weld. Plate welding is contributes to the UK economy through the fabrication, construction and upgrade of major infrastructure projects, defence assets and exported goods. Plate welders are employed by the supply chain organisations or the direct owner/operator.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide range of people and organisations including Platers, Metal Fabricators, Erectors, Riggers, Stores Operatives, Supervisors, Engineers, Inspectors, Non-Destructive Technicians and Quality personnel. Plate welders may need to work shifts and flexible work patterns. They can work in organisations ranging from multi-national organisations to very small businesses. They work in a range of environments across the world including Fabrication Shops, Assembly Yards, Construction/Building Sites, Factories and Operational Facilities requiring maintenance &amp;amp; upgrade. This occupation may involve working at height, and beside or over water. Plate welders’ work will be regularly assessed to ensure continued quality of welding and overall integrity of the component being welded, as specified in the applicable component design code. This could include visual inspection, non-destructive testing and destructive testing of production test pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the safety, quality and accuracy of their own work whilst ensuring it conforms to a relevant plate welding specification. They work autonomously, or on occasion as part of a wider team, reporting to a workplace supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the media industries and covers the Post Production area for Film, TV and Advertising. Post-production is effectively the final step in the making of a film or television programme and associated products, is the process of refinement and transition of productions’ raw materials into a finished product before distribution and release to the public. Post Production Technical Operators are employed by audio and picture post-production companies, visual effects companies, broadcasters and by film and TV production companies who have their own facilities.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide support, assistance and delivery within the technical support operation of a post-production company. Core duties include (but are not limited to) first line technical and edit support for the workflow and lifecycle of the content in post-production, media backup, ingest and export. The core objective of the role is to ensure that the technical support operations are fulfilled effectively and efficiently to the technical specification provided. Each company engaged in post-production, of whatever size, employs Technical Operators to prepare, manage and deliver the assets and creative media handled during the post production process.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with creative colleagues in editing, visual effects or production teams, as well as clients. This is a junior position into the Master Control Room (MCR) department, the role is often shift based and may involve working alone or as part of a larger team; they will report to senior technical managers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for applying technical knowledge and understanding to the post production process in film, TV and Advertising. Post-Production Technical Operators are given high levels of responsibility with sensitive material, working to specific and varied technical standards within time-limited deadlines. In this role, they are responsible for assessing quality of content and carrying out corrective measures where possible. They have to be able to analyse source material/content and interpret and apply technical specifications to this. Although it is a technical role, there is a need to have an eye for the creative processes in post production such as editing, audio mixing and colour grading. The roles require an understanding of current digital file-based workflows as well as legacy media. Creative personnel in picture editing, grading and audio dubbing suites depend on the picture and audio files produced by technicians in this role. They are known by a variety of job titles, depending on the specific services provided by their employer, however the core technical understanding that they use applies across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;"

Consistent risk assessment, professional curiosity and liaison with other agencies are key factors in effective management of service users.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, Probation Officers interact with complex and challenging individuals who pose a higher level of risk to the public and victims (for example individuals who have committed offences of a sexual, violent or extremist nature) To support this work, a Probation Officer is required to develop and maintain strong relationships with a range of partners including courts, police, prisons, local authority, youth justice teams, public/mental health providers and the voluntary sectors. This enables a Probation Officer to effectively manage the risk posed by complex and challenging individuals and formulate robust assessments and identification of intensive structure interventions. A Probation Officer is required to work from a range of locations including community office bases, prisons, courts or can be co-located within multi-agency teams. A Probation Officer is also required to undertake home visits.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for providing assessments of service users to aid sentencing and delivery of the sentence, with the aim of achieving long term change and a reduction in re-offending. A Probation Officer will develop ways of working that are grounded in academic research and capable of informing comprehensive plans of intervention, with involvement of specialists and provision from other professionals according to assessed risks, needs and vulnerabilities. A Probation Officer will have a heightened awareness of responsibilities in relation to safeguarding children and adults and child protection and will support victims of sexual offences, domestic abuse, extremism and hate crime. Probation Officers work as part of a team to meet operational targets, achieve high standards of quality. A Probation Officer is involved in the planning, development and evaluation of services and special projects. A Probation Officer shares their knowledge and experience, possibly overseeing the work of others with others.&lt;/p&gt;"

They offer evidence based interventions to patients with mild to moderate anxiety and depression as well as other common mental health problems determined by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)*1, the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)*2 manual. PWPs operate within a stepped care service delivery model which operates on the principle of offering the least intrusive effective psychological treatment in the first instance, patients can then be ‘stepped up’ to a more intensive treatment if required. The treatment aids clinical improvement and social inclusion, such as a return to work, meaningful activity or physical wellbeing and is delivered through a variety of methods including individual work courses and group work, which can be via face-to-face, telephone, email or other contact methods including digital platforms.They work alongside existing psychological practitioners such as High Intensity Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Cognitive Behaviour Therapy practitioners.&#160; PWPs undertake assessments mainly for moderate anxiety and depression protocols with referral to senior professionals for complex problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*1 https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;*2 https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/the-iapt-manual.pdf&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wider psychological therapies team which may include other health professionals such as psychologists, therapists, counsellors, employment specialists, community nurses and administrative staff.

They monitor and promote health and wellbeing to ensure fairer health outcomes between different communities and groups (health inequalities). They put in place protection measures to protect the public from environmental hazards and risks. They evaluate sources of evidence, interpret it and design and plan health interventions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PHPs work independently and collaboratively, both within their organisation and with others, to initiate and develop public health interventions and services (eg: obesity prevention programmes; infection prevention and control programmes; national risk-assessment and screening programmes). They work in a wide range of settings (eg: office, community, healthcare), working with different types of organisations (see list above), and with professionals and members of the public. They will usually be part of a team of public health professionals and may report to public health specialists and consultants from a range of backgrounds (including medicine). They might be expected to work out-of-hours or on-call so they need to be flexible and adaptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a professionally competent PHP they act autonomously within the scope of their role. They implement plans and policies, and may help to develop those plans. They take responsibility for their continuous development; and the development, and possibly the supervision, of others. They manage their own workload and the prioritisation of activities, utilising their problem solving skills in a complex and changing environment. They may also be responsible for resources such as people, budgets, equipment or facilities.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in supervisory and regulatory organisations and authorities across the public sector, who monitor and investigate levels of compliance. This occupation is distinct to the public sector, as only the government can apply civil and criminal penalties, or pursue public prosecutions. Compliance staff need to understand, investigate and negotiate with individuals and organisations who, by accident or with intent, may not be complying with or are deliberately evading regulation or law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to protect the UK’s public interest, money and services, driving improved customer compliance that supports the honest majority who meet their obligations and makes it hard for the dishonest minority, identifying potential acts of criminality and supporting civil or criminal proceedings. This raises standards of compliance across the UK, treating everybody fairly and with respect, applying the law impartially with integrity and honesty. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with colleagues, working independently with a team of Compliance Officers/Investigators, reporting to a senior manager. Employees liaise with other specialists and professions, including policy and legal teams. They will interact with customers that range from individuals to large corporate organisations, identifying and investigating possible or apparent anomalies in documentation or other sources of evidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Employees may also interact with 3rd party agencies in order to support their work, such as local authorities or law enforcement agencies, as well as representing their organisation at tribunals or in court. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for conducting risk-based compliance checks and investigations by applying appropriate legislation, case law, policy and procedure, so that casework can be carried out with integrity and minimal opportunity for technical error. They will work independently to obtain evidence through various fact-finding methodologies, which may range from reviewing documents to contentious interviews. They will exercise judgement and discretion within specified parameters to test credibility and will make evidence-based decisions and recommendations, including when to escalate an issue, and to whom. Compliance Officers/Investigators will make recommendations and judgements within defined parameters, obtaining authority to proceed from a Senior Manager for decisions that fall outside those parameters.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in every sector. Registered nurses work in the public, independent and voluntary sector. Registered nurses are a statutorily regulated profession and the standards for proficiency are set by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and successful completion of this apprenticeship will meet the education requirements to see registration with the NMC. This standard covers the NMC Standards for Proficiency and Annexes A &amp;amp; B for registered nurses (May 2018) and covers the four fields of practice that are Adult, Mental Health, Learning Disability and Child. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to play a vital role in providing, leading, coordinating and evaluating care that is compassionate, evidence based, and person centred. They are accountable for their own actions and those who they delegate to and must be able to work autonomously, or as an equal partner with a range of other professionals. They provide nursing care for people across the whole lifespan who could have complex and concurrent mental, physical, cognitive and behavioural care needs and for people at the end of their life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Registered nurses make an important contribution to the promotion of health, health protection and the prevention of ill health. They do this by empowering people, communities and populations to exercise choice, take control of their own health decisions and behaviours and by supporting people to manage their own care where possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a variety of service users, families and carers, and with an extensive range of health and care professionals and other agencies including social services, police, probation, prisons, housing, education, language interpreters and third sector agencies. They will also work with, support and facilitate the learning of a range of learners from across health and care professions. They might be working in a hospital, someone’s home, the community, social care or public health and may work various shift patterns which enable care to be provided 24 hours per day, seven days per week, 365 days of the year. Registered nurses are a key part of the multidisciplinary teams that meet the integrated health and care needs of patients and service users. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for providing leadership in the delivery of care for people of all ages and from different backgrounds, cultures and beliefs. They must be able to care for people in their own home, in the community or hospital or in any health care settings where their needs are supported and managed. All registered nurses work as part of a team but on a day to day basis may be working alone when seeing people in their own homes or in the community. They work in the context of continual change, challenging environments, different models of care delivery, an older and more diverse population, innovation and rapidly evolving technologies. Increasing integration of health and social care services will require registered nurses to negotiate boundaries and play a proactive role in multidisciplinary teams. The confidence and ability to think critically, apply knowledge and skills and provide expert, evidence based, direct nursing care therefore lies at the centre of all registered nursing practice. In order to respond to the impact and demands of professional nursing practice, they must be emotionally intelligent and resilient individuals, able to manage their own personal health and wellbeing, and know when and how to access support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Registered nurses may have responsibility for delegating work to other members of the nursing team and take accountability for the delegated activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the health sector and includes the NHS and private healthcare providers working in hospitals and clinics.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to conduct diagnostic and screening ultrasound examinations. Ultrasound is the use of highly specialised scanning equipment to create echoes of high-frequency sound waves that can be bounced off body tissues. The echoes are then converted into an image called a sonogram. Ultrasound imaging allows an inside view of soft tissues and the body, to examine anatomy and identify problems. Sonographers perform and report a wide range of clinical ultrasound examinations within a defined area of practice. They undertake scans which may include but are not limited to cancer detection, women&#39;s health and pregnancy, abdominal, vascular and musculoskeletal examinations, although their individual scope of practice can be wide and varied. It requires extremely good hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness and excellent interpersonal skills.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with patients, their carers, members of the public and a range of healthcare professionals, e.g. doctors, midwives, nurses and radiographers. The sonographer will be competent to practice independently in this discipline but will work as part of a wider clinical team. They are independent professional practitioners responsible for managing their own work and for a wide range of specialist ultrasound scanning equipment and resources. They typically report to advanced practitioners, and may supervise healthcare assistants and clinical support workers.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a variety of contexts, including the NHS, local authorities, voluntary, community, and social enterprise sector (VCS) organisations, the education and justice sectors and in independent practice.&#160; Speech and Language Therapists (SLTs) are regulated by the Health and Care Professions Council and are uniquely qualified to provide speech, language, communication and eating, drinking and swallowing therapies. They work in many settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, in the community, within charities, schools, and peoples’ homes. There are opportunities throughout your career to specialise and move into leadership, training and research roles.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to improve quality of life, health and well-being for people with communication difficulties and/or dysphagia (eating, drinking and swallowing difficulties). Applying evidence-based science to clinical practice, SLTs are the lead professionals who assess and improve outcomes for people who have speech, language, communication needs (SLCN), voice, fluency, and/or eating, drinking and swallowing difficulties.&#160; Communication and eating and drinking difficulties can have a significant impact on someone’s life from birth to death. There is huge variety in roles; some SLTs work with children to identify and develop their communication difficulties so they can reach their full potential, whereas others work with adults with conditions that affect their communication and/or swallowing such as stroke, dementia or Parkinson’s or support those with learning disabilities to communicate. Others might carry out research or work in specialist medical units or provide advice on communication aids, for example, to children with cerebral palsy.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with babies, infants, children, young people and adults who may have speech, language, and communication needs and/or difficulties with eating, drinking, and swallowing. SLTs frequently work as part of a team alongside other health, education and social care professionals, including nurses, Allied Health Professionals (AHPs), social workers, doctors, teachers and teaching assistants, educational and clinical psychologists, families/carers and volunteers. SLTs provide person-centred care, recognising and valuing the key contribution of the person and their family/carers in developing appropriate support&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the prevention, assessment, diagnosis, therapeutic interventions and management of an individual’s speech, language, communication, and/or eating, drinking and swallowing difficulties.&#160; The SLT will play a central role in the health, well-being and participation of people with a range of developmental, and/or acquired conditions which may include end of life care and learning disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;SLTs are autonomous professionals, responsible and accountable for their actions. They are also responsible for ensuring their knowledge and skills remain current, through evidence-based practice and maintaining professional competence. The SLT will also play a role in supporting other peoples’ learning, including future entrants to the profession, demonstrate leadership qualities, and may manage and lead colleagues/services.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the creative media industries. Storyboard artists will typically be employed by a range of small to large production companies working within the British and International animation, film, television, visual effects, games and advertising industries. A storyboard is a series of sequential art that conveys the story and character in a visual media such as film, television or games. Its purpose is to communicate the visual story to colleagues, clients and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Storyboard Artist is a highly skilled and creative individual who is required during the first phase of production, called pre-production; storyboards are sequences from script/brief/screenplays translated into a series of illustrations.&#160; The broad purpose of the occupation is to use storyboards to visualise the narrative, planning shots and drawing panels to demonstrate the staging/action, and maintain continuity between scenes of a production.&#160; An employee in this occupation will be responsible for preparing storyboards for production, including indications of dialogue, character performance and camera moves, and they could be asked to produce their work either as rough drawing or cleaned-up (more defined) drawings.&#160; Traditionally storyboards are drawn on paper from pen or pencil, however, with the integration of computers these may be created digitally; with either method the Storyboard Artist has to conceptualise and imagine the scenes to be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A key duty of the role is presenting the drawings and storyboards to colleagues, clients and stakeholders. The presentation of a storyboard is part of the overall pre-production process, it is used to demonstrate the film or content before signed off to proceed to the next stage of production; and it moves through the workflow from pre-production to production.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Storyboard Artists need to know and understand how the camera moves, how to frame the subject, types of shot such as wide, extreme close up and worms eye view. They also need to know and understand the key errors to avoid, such as dead centre compositions, tilted oblique angles and splitting the screen in half with horizontal lines.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the Director and, possibly, with the scriptwriter, Producer, client or Storyboard Supervisor, to visualise and tell the story. They are usually based in either an office environment, or work remotely from their own offices/place of work working on commercials, television series, games, short form work and feature films.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This role may include out of hours or irregular working patterns when collaborating on international projects.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Duties&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Manage story board work on designated projects&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Interpret a creative brief or script to create storyboards&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Visualise the story and convey this in drawings&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Prepare drawings for storyboards or other preparatory visualisations&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Present storyboards to colleagues and clients&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Work effectively with creative colleagues and clients&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Manage own working practices in the creative industries&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Manage the media content/assets created&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Manage and market yourself and your services to productions&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Manage own development&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the health and care sector and includes the NHS and private healthcare providers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide excellent care to patients diagnosed with cancer by delivering high quality and accurate radiotherapy, taking into consideration patients’ emotional, psychological, and physical needs through the stages of their cancer treatment when at times they may be extremely vulnerable. You will be responsible for the patient from the time of referral for radiotherapy by a cancer specialist and will undertake pre-treatment preparation of radiotherapy patients, such as scanning and planning the patients’ radiotherapy. Therapeutic radiographers provide the highest standard of technical practice and patient care in order to treat and support adults, teenagers and children receiving radiotherapy (predominately for cancer) using a variety of forms such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• external beam radiotherapy, a method for delivering a beam or several beams of high energy X-rays to a patient’s cancer;&lt;br /&gt;• brachytherapy, a form of radiotherapy where a sealed radiation source (eg in a needle or tube) is placed inside or next to the patient’s cancer;&lt;br /&gt;• stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery which delivers multiple beams of focused radiation &lt;br /&gt;• proton therapy, a type of particle therapy that uses a beam of protons to deliver a radiation dose to a patient’s cancer; &lt;br /&gt;• superficial skin radiotherapy, which uses X-rays or electrons to deliver a radiation dose to a patient’s cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with cancer patients, who may or may not be cured, their carer(s), members of the public and a range of healthcare professionals eg physicists, dosimetrists, doctors, nurses and dietitians, in a variety of settings such as hospitals and hospices. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for planning, checking and using imaging to deliver accurate radiotherapy in a compassionate and caring manner. As an autonomous practitioner, they will have responsibility for the patient from the time of referral for radiotherapy by a cancer specialist, through to aftercare and on-going support after radiotherapy. They will be accountable professionally and legally for their actions and those they are supervising.&lt;/p&gt;"

An employee in this occupation will be responsible for activities relating to the construction and renewal of the Tramway, including, setting up and maintaining a temporary traffic management system including assisting stakeholders with access and deliveries, lifting and moving large and irregular shaped loads, installing and removing temporary works, using a range of hand held tools, equipment and items of plant and being able to carry out site clearance activities such as the removal of waste items and the storage of reusable materials and components. Whilst undertaking these activities, operatives are expected to adhere to strict codes of conduct and safe working practices including wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment, following the correct safe systems and taking action to minimise risk to self and others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operatives work in shifts and outdoors often in challenging inner city or town environments. A knowledge of the environment, how pedestrianised and road traffic areas relate to each other and the relationship between the relevant stakeholders is essential as well as a detailed understanding of the effect the works (noise, dust, vibration, traffic control and management systems) can have on the surrounding environment. This includes different types of building such as grade II listed, the public who may be working/shopping/visiting/passing through the area and the businesses that need to be able to operate whist works are being carried out. Presentation and conduct when working in a public facing/urban and open working environment is important and operatives are expected to adhere to organisational policies and requirements and have the skills to be able to deal with questions and enquiries as well as challenging behaviour by others who may be affected, frustrated or disrupted by the work being undertaken. The inner city or urban environment can present many other challenges including, interaction with contractors on other construction projects and a restriction on working space. Being able to manoeuvre large and irregular shaped loads through the confines of the urban environment is a skill apprentices will learn as well as techniques for carrying out activities with minimal noise, dust, vibration etc. Often the use of large plant equipment is not possible and manual techniques are required. The cities and towns in England are often steeped in history and digging and excavating can often uncover a wide range of items, most commonly utilities (live and historic) not shown on plans and specifications. Knowing how to identify, deal and report with these items is an important part of the role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The level of customer interaction can be high as the tramway construction environment is often what’s known as ‘open working’ which makes this different to other construction activities which usually take place in a closed environment/site. Operatives are working in areas where there are many nearby businesses or houses which have to remain open and accessible and as such members of the general public will be nearby and will be able to see the works being undertaken. Operatives conduct and behaviour is particularly important as they represent not only the individual organisations undertaking the construction and renewals activities but the industry as a whole. The apprenticeship will contain knowledge skills and behaviours to prepare an operative for customer interaction including the skills to deal with questions and be able to de-escalate issues and potential conflict. The ability to manage challenging situations is a regular occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;A Vehicle Damage Assessor (VDA) works within the Automotive Bodyshop Industry. This industry employs around 200,000 people in a range of large, medium sized and small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to methodically and accurately inspect and assess all elements of a motor vehicle that has sustained damage and requires repair. They will be able to identify and record damage on a vehicle and determine (using prescribed information from Manufacturers) which parts of the vehicle should be repaired or replaced. A VDA will have an understanding of the manual process of assessing and costing repair of a vehicle, whilst also being able to use the relevant electronic estimating software. They will have knowledge of all types of vehicles including petrol, diesel, electric and hybrid. A VDA will stay abreast of ever changing autonomous technological vehicle safety developments known as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The VDA will produce accurate &amp;amp; detailed repair specifications to be used to carry out the required repair process. They will have commercial knowledge of their respective workplace and know how to apply this in order to determine a monetary cost and timescale for each repair job.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the customer of the damaged vehicle, the Bodyshop manager, vehicle repair technicians and office/administrative staff at their company and insurance companies.&#160; The assessor will work alone (once qualified) to assess the vehicle but will also liaise with the customer, insurance company and vehicle technicians to discuss the assessment, damage to the vehicle and how it will be repaired.&#160; The assessor may report to the Bodyshop manager, or sometimes the commercial director or other members of staff, depending on the staffing structure within their own organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for producing an accurate estimate to carry out a repair job which is subsequently agreed by key stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A VDA will have excellent communication skills, be able to negotiate and have a methodical approach to work.&#160; Being able to carry out work accurately is essential.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in organisations where there is a responsibility to manage the impact of water environments, natural or manmade, on the land and surrounding businesses and homes. The water environment includes rivers, coasts (the sea), lakes, wetlands, canals and reservoirs. Water can cause erosion to our coasts and riverbanks, damage assets and infrastructure, e.g. canal walls, and create the risk of flooding on both a small and major scale. Flooding can come from multiple sources, including from rivers, the coast, surface water and groundwater, and organisations who work in this area are often involved in preparation, response and recovery following flooding from all sources. There is also a responsibility to protect water quality and to monitor its impact on habitats for wildlife. The prevention of environmental pollution in our waters and wetlands and meeting the objectives outlined in the Water Framework Directive is essential for creating and maintaining natural habitats.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to create a safe environment where the public can enjoy our water environments and the surrounding land and buildings, whilst protecting the environment, and creating habitats for species to thrive. This includes minimising flood and environmental incidents by utilising assets to manage water levels and using techniques to mitigate the impact of pollution, particularly in natural habitats.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with members of the public as they are carrying out their duties in the field. Members of the public can include paying customers as well as the general public making use of towpaths, other public pathways and the water environment. In addition, employees will work with contractors, paid to deliver projects (usually of a construction nature, but may include maintenance), volunteers, who offer time and services to invest in their local environment, and other teams from their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for delivering their scheduled work activities to time and on budget. Where required, they will be responsible for any plant and equipment supplied to carry out their duties. Whilst part of a team, they may be working alone in the field, and will be required to carry out duties in a safe manner in accordance with their organisation’s health, safety and wellbeing procedures. When not working alone they will be expected to be aware of the safety of others working alongside them, for them, or visiting the area, e.g. contractors, as well as members of the public. As a frontline representative of their organisation they are expected to display their organisation’s values and behaviours and respond to customer queries in a positive manner. They may be responsible for maintaining water levels to mitigate against the effect of flooding.&lt;/p&gt;"
